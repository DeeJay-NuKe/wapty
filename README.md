# Don't use this.
## Really, don't
### But if you really do want to use this
no dependencies, no need to install, just
```
go run wapty.go
```
on your browser set localhost:8080 as proxy

BEWARE: ignore proxy for localhost

Then visit localhost:8081

Scroll down for history, open console for metadata. (No UI yet for that sorry)

Enable interceptor, have fun, report bugs.
